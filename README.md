## What is Glitch_Beam
In 2014(I was 13 or 14 lol) I began work on a game called glitch(then Glitch Unbugged). At the time the main mechanic of the game was that you could switch levels with spacebar while staying at the same location. I ended up discontinuing the project. 3 years(I was like 16 or 17) later I picked the project back up(and subsequently renamed it Glitch_Beam). I switched the engine from the GameMaker Studio to the then newly released GameMaker Studio 2. I also changed the core mechanics to the ability to flip the gravity of the player character(and more).
### What Glitch meant to me
I got into computer science because I wanted to learn how to make video games. From the time I was 8 seeing the Java loading screen on RuneScape, to the time I started the project in 2014 I had always wanted to make my own video game. Glitch_Beam was a game I created(lacking in content or a definite ending cause it's endless), a complete game, that showed me that I had the capability to code, that I could create software. All that I made was a small game but it opened up my fascination to the other fields that exist in Computer Science. 

## No Point in Cloning
There is no point in cloning this repository for it doesn't contain all the files of the project yet. Even if it did contain all the project files, you wouldn't be able to mess around with it without downloading GameMaker Studio 2.
